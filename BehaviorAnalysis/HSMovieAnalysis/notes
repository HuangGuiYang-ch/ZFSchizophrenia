Many of the included files here are not used in the tracking, but this code was built off of code from Ian Woods paper:
"VideoHacking: Automated Tracking and Quantification of Locomotor Behavior with Open Source Software and Off-the-Shelf Video Equipment."
Some of the functions from this paper are used in my tracking code, but much is not and is still included here because I did not bother to remove dependencies.
